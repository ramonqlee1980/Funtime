Welcome to Flurry!

The Flurry iPhone Agent allows you to track the usage and behavior of your application on users' phones for viewing in the Flurry system. You can also choose to use the Flurry platform to serve advertisements inside your application and earn revenue from your users. It is designed to  be as easy as possible with a basic setup complete in under 5 minutes.

This archive should contain a file ProjectApiKey.txt which contains your Flurry API key which you will need in order to integrate the SDK.
